# E-commerce-back-end

## Description

-I wanted to create an E-commerce database in order to better understand how companies sell and manage stock when selling online.

-While working through this challenge I ran into a few different problems. First was attempting to set up relationships between tables. I got confused with manyToMany relationships thinking that if one had a manyToMany they all had to be that way instead of one category having many and another belonging to that table. Second, I was having a hard time establishing the routes when using include:, I was either not including enough or including too many which was messing up my route.

-I am grateful to Juan Delgado my tutor, because he was helpful in putting me on the right path with establishing my routes as well as my models for my tables because I was adding too many keys that was effecting the routes.
